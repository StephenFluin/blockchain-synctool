# Blockchain Synctool.

This project was forked from the February 23rd version of [Axelar Examples](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-examples).

It consists of an Angular web app FE for demonstration and marketing purposes as well as a hardhat project (from Axelar) with customized Smart Contract code. It is hosted on Firebase.

This project is designed to be an extensible way for developers to sync contract state between blockchains.

The demo for this project can be seen at https://synctool.dev.

## Running locally

```bash
yarn
yarn setup
yarn start
```


## Todo
[ ] Angular 15 doesn't work with ethers nicely. I don't know why. Bundling changes & typescript changes likely.
